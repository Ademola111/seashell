# Seashell

### Seashell is a website application that is used to identify different seashell.

With the integration of Machine Learning and some seashell dataset the webapp will be able to identify each seashell uploaded and state it's name.\
Dataset is taken from this website.
[Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0230-3)\
To generate the CNN model -

```
cd model
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cnn_final_model.py
python predict.py
```

The process to prediction is shown in the model/predict.py\
Please generate the model first from cnn_final_model.py before using predict.py\
Note the image preprocessing done in predict before using the model for prediction
